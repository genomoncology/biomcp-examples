## Emerging Treatment Strategies in Head and Neck Cancers

## Introduction

Head and neck cancers encompass a group of tumors arising in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx, with **major subtypes** including **oropharyngeal**, **laryngeal**, and **nasopharyngeal** carcinomas. These subtypes differ in epidemiology and biology – for example, oropharyngeal cancers are often driven by human papillomavirus (HPV), whereas nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. Standard treatment has traditionally involved some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and platinum-based chemotherapy. While these conventional modalities cure many early-stage patients, outcomes in advanced disease remain suboptimal, and treatment can be very toxic [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1445191/full#:~:text=need%20to%20develop%20novel%20treatments,in%20which%20monoclonal%20antibodies%20are) [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1445191/full#:~:text=tissues,line). This has spurred **emerging treatment strategies** aimed at improving survival and reducing toxicity through novel therapies. Below we summarize up-to-date advances in immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and other experimental approaches for head and neck cancers, highlighting new approvals, clinical trials, and precision medicine tactics for each major subtype.

## Advances in Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy – especially immune checkpoint inhibitors – has transformed the treatment landscape of recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibodies **pembrolizumab** and **nivolumab** were the first immunotherapies proven effective in HNSCC and are now approved standards of care [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38729034#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20anti,in%20head%20and%20neck%20cancer). In the pivotal KEYNOTE-048 trial, first-line pembrolizumab (alone or with chemotherapy) significantly **improved overall survival** in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC compared to the previous EXTREME chemotherapy/cetuximab regimen [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=In%20the%20final%20analysis%20of,pembrolizumab%20was%20noninferior%20to%20chemotherapy). Pembrolizumab monotherapy prolonged median survival to ~14.9 months in PD-L1–positive patients vs ~10.7 months with the EXTREME regimen [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31679945/#:~:text=Pembrolizumab%20alone%20or%20with%20chemotherapy,vs%2010%C2%B77%20months%2C%20hazard) [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=In%20the%20final%20analysis%20of,pembrolizumab%20was%20noninferior%20to%20chemotherapy). Combination pembrolizumab + chemotherapy also improved survival in the overall population [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=targeted%20therapy%20,pembrolizumab%20was%20noninferior%20to%20chemotherapy). Nivolumab likewise demonstrated a survival benefit in platinum-refractory HNSCC, nearly doubling one-year survival vs chemotherapy (36% vs 17%) in the CheckMate-141 trial [referencecitationanalysis.com](https://www.referencecitationanalysis.com/citearticles?term=%5B%7B%22c%22%3Anull%2C%22id%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22o%22%3Anull%2C%22v%22%3A%2210.1200%2Fjco.19.00555%22%2C%22b%22%3Anull%2C%22f%22%3Anull%7D%5D#:~:text=Abstract). These checkpoint inhibitors produce durable responses (~15–20% of patients achieve tumor shrinkage) with fewer severe toxicities than chemo [referencecitationanalysis.com](https://www.referencecitationanalysis.com/citearticles?term=%5B%7B%22c%22%3Anull%2C%22id%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22o%22%3Anull%2C%22v%22%3A%2210.1200%2Fjco.19.00555%22%2C%22b%22%3Anull%2C%22f%22%3Anull%7D%5D#:~:text=Head%20and%20neck%20cancer%20is,well%20as%20novel%20targets%20and). As a result, **PD-1 inhibitors are now a cornerstone** for relapsed/metastatic oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancers, used either alone or with chemotherapy based on biomarkers like PD-L1 expression [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=In%20the%20final%20analysis%20of,pembrolizumab%20was%20noninferior%20to%20chemotherapy).

**New immunotherapy approvals** have continued to expand options. Notably, in 2023 the FDA approved the PD-1 inhibitor **toripalimab (Loqtorzi)** as the first immunotherapy for **nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)** [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration,of%20head%20and%20neck%20cancer) [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=FDA%E2%80%99s%20approval%20of%20the%20drug%E2%80%94the,on%20or%20after%20standard%20chemotherapy). In a phase III trial for recurrent/metastatic NPC, adding toripalimab to chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival – after 3 years, 64% of patients on the toripalimab combo were alive vs 49% with chemotherapy alone. This landmark approval has made immunotherapy part of first-line treatment in NPC, immediately changing the standard of care [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=FDA%E2%80%99s%20approval%20of%20the%20drug%E2%80%94the,on%20or%20after%20standard%20chemotherapy). Toripalimab is also approved as monotherapy for NPC that progresses after chemo, based on trials showing it can shrink tumors or stabilize disease in a subset of heavily pretreated patients [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=In%20one%20trial%2C%20people%20with,those%20who%20received%20chemotherapy%20alone) [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=survival%20,received%20chemotherapy%20alone). Beyond toripalimab, other checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and others) are being evaluated in NPC and show activity, though toripalimab’s approval is the first in this subtype [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=FDA%E2%80%99s%20approval%20of%20the%20drug%E2%80%94the,on%20or%20after%20standard%20chemotherapy).

**Moving immunotherapy into earlier-stage disease** is another important strategy. For example, the phase III KEYNOTE-689 trial tested **perioperative pembrolizumab** (given before and after surgery) in locally advanced resectable HNSCC. This trial *met its primary endpoint*, showing significantly improved event-free survival with pembrolizumab immunotherapy compared to surgery alone [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/perioperative-pembrolizumab-betters-survival-in-stage-iii-iv-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=Perioperative%20pembrolizumab%20,689%20study%20%28NCT03765918%29.%5E%7B1). It is the first positive trial in decades for resected locally advanced HNSCC [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/perioperative-pembrolizumab-betters-survival-in-stage-iii-iv-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThese%20results%20are%20substantial%2C%20as,%E2%80%9D) and suggests that adding immunotherapy in the curative setting may reduce recurrence risk. A trend toward better overall survival was also observed [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/perioperative-pembrolizumab-betters-survival-in-stage-iii-iv-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=release,%E2%80%9D). These findings are potentially practice-changing, and regulatory approvals or guideline changes may follow to incorporate perioperative pembrolizumab for certain high-risk patients. In parallel, other studies are examining adjuvant immunotherapy after chemoradiation in unresectable disease. (Notably, one trial of durvalumab after chemoradiation did not show a clear benefit, tempering enthusiasm and indicating patient selection is key [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/news/december-2022/first-line-nivolumabipilimumab-vs-extreme-regimen-in-recurrent-or-metastatic-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=First,line%20nivolumab%2Fipilimumab).)

**Novel immunotherapy combinations** are a major research focus to increase response rates beyond the ~20% achieved with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade alone. One promising avenue is dual-checkpoint or multi-target immunotherapy. For instance, a recent phase IIb trial (TACTI-003) combined pembrolizumab with **eftilagimod alpha (efti)**, a soluble LAG-3 fusion protein that stimulates antigen-presenting cells. In PD-L1–negative HNSCC patients (who typically respond poorly to PD-1 monotherapy), the efti + pembrolizumab combo achieved a **35.5% overall response rate**, far exceeding historical controls (~5% ORR with PD-1 alone in this subgroup) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/new-immunotherapy-combination-effective-in-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=Eftilagimod%20alpha%20,1) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/new-immunotherapy-combination-effective-in-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=An%20overall%20response%20rate%20,1%20monotherapy). Even complete responses were observed (nearly 10% of patients) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/new-immunotherapy-combination-effective-in-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=An%20overall%20response%20rate%20,1%20monotherapy). These results, presented at ESMO 2024, are significant for PD-L1–negative patients “for whom chemotherapy is the current first-line treatment” [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/new-immunotherapy-combination-effective-in-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=58.1,1%20monotherapy). The combo was well tolerated and has received FDA Fast Track designation for first-line HNSCC [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/new-immunotherapy-combination-effective-in-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=Regarding%20safety%2C%20the%20combination%20appears,safety%20signals%20have%20been%20identified). Similarly, agents that block LAG-3 (like relatlimab) or other checkpoints are being tested with PD-1 inhibitors in head and neck cancer. By reinvigorating T-cells through multiple pathways, these combinations aim to convert more tumors to responders.

Other immunotherapy combos pair checkpoint blockade with **targeted therapies or novel immunomodulators**. An example is combining anti–PD-1 with anti–VEGF therapy: a 2025 phase II trial in Singapore found that adding **bevacizumab** (an anti-angiogenic antibody) to pembrolizumab in refractory NPC boosted the response rate to 58% versus only 12.5% with pembrolizumab alone [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/news/february-2025/addition-of-bevacizumab-to-pembrolizumab-in-platinum-resistant-recurrent-or-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/#:~:text=Median%20follow,CI). Progression-free survival jumped from a median of ~1.6 months to 13.8 months with the bevacizumab–pembrolizumab regimen [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/news/february-2025/addition-of-bevacizumab-to-pembrolizumab-in-platinum-resistant-recurrent-or-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/#:~:text=Median%20follow,CI) [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/news/february-2025/addition-of-bevacizumab-to-pembrolizumab-in-platinum-resistant-recurrent-or-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/#:~:text=95,CI). This dramatic synergy suggests that VEGF-mediated immunosuppression was hindering responses, and blocking it unleashed pembrolizumab’s efficacy. Combination trials of **tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)** like lenvatinib (VEGFR inhibitor) with pembrolizumab have likewise shown improved response rates in HNSCC [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/march-25-2024/lenvatinib-plus-pembrolizumab-fails-to-improve-overall-survival-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=,combination%20of%20lenvatinib%20and). In the phase III LEAP-010 trial, pembrolizumab + lenvatinib led to an ORR of ~46% vs 25% with pembrolizumab alone [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/march-25-2024/lenvatinib-plus-pembrolizumab-fails-to-improve-overall-survival-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=Lenvatinib%20Plus%20Pembrolizumab%20Fails%20to,combination%20of%20lenvatinib%20and) [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/march-25-2024/lenvatinib-plus-pembrolizumab-fails-to-improve-overall-survival-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=Findings%20from%20the%20LEAP,combination%20of%20lenvatinib%20and) and significantly prolonged progression-free survival, though it did not ultimately improve overall survival [onclive.com](https://www.onclive.com/view/leap-010-trial-discontinued-after-os-projection-with-pembrolizumab-lenvatinib-in-metastatic-hnscc#:~:text=LEAP,survival%20and%20objective%20response%20rate). While LEAP-010 was discontinued due to lack of OS benefit [onclive.com](https://www.onclive.com/view/leap-010-trial-discontinued-after-os-projection-with-pembrolizumab-lenvatinib-in-metastatic-hnscc#:~:text=LEAP,survival%20and%20objective%20response%20rate), the strategy of immunotherapy plus anti-angiogenic therapy remains promising (especially given the NPC bevacizumab results) and is being refined.

**Cellular immunotherapy** is also emerging for head and neck cancers, though still experimental. **CAR T-cell therapy** – genetically engineering a patient’s T cells to attack tumor antigens – has revolutionized leukemias and lymphomas, and researchers are adapting it to solid tumors including HNSCC [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=histocompatibility%20complex%20%28MHC%29,T%20cell%20therapy%20in%20HNSCC) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=total%20of%204%20generations%20of,were%20approved%20by%20the%20FDA). Early-phase trials are investigating CAR T-cells against targets like **EGFR** (highly expressed in HNSCC), **HER2**, and **EpCAM**, as well as virus-specific targets in virally driven tumors [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=of%20glioblastomas%20%28GBMs%29%20,epidermal%20growth%20factor%20receptor%202) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20clinical%20trials,T%20cells%20could). In one pilot study, an EGFR-directed CAR T given by intratumoral injection achieved disease control in 69% of evaluable HNSCC patients [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20clinical%20trials,positive) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=and%20cytotoxic%20efficacy%20of%20an,cells%20targeting%20the%20epithelial%20cell). Another trial is testing CAR T-cells targeting **HER2** combined with an oncolytic adenovirus to enhance CAR T expansion in the tumor microenvironment [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=evaluated%20patients%2C%20the%20overall%20disease,trials%20to%20verify%20their%20safety). For nasopharyngeal carcinoma, CAR T-cells directed at EBV antigens such as **LMP1** are in development [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=phase%20I%20clinical%20trial%20of,the%20treatment%20of%20nasopharyngeal%20carcinoma). These approaches are in Phase I safety testing and face challenges (solid tumor CAR T-cells must overcome dense tumor stroma, immunosuppressive microenvironment, and antigen heterogeneity [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=Looking%20for%20new%20targets%20of,of%20HNSCC%20cells%20compared%20to) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=4.%20Barriers%20of%20CAR,in%20HNSCC%20and%20Potential%20Solutions) ). Nevertheless, preliminary results show feasibility, and ongoing trials continue to **refine CAR T-cell design** (e.g. adding chemokine receptors or switch receptors) to improve trafficking and efficacy in head and neck tumors [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=4.%20Barriers%20of%20CAR,in%20HNSCC%20and%20Potential%20Solutions) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=hypoxia%20and%20low,site%20infiltration%2C%20anti). Similarly, **tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy** – harvesting and expanding a patient’s own T cells from the tumor – is being explored in HNSCC after successes in melanoma. These personalized cell therapies may offer hope for immunotherapy-refractory cases in the future.

Other innovative immunotherapies under investigation include **therapeutic cancer vaccines** and **bispecific T-cell engagers**. For HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers, therapeutic vaccines aim to stimulate T-cells against HPV oncoproteins (E6/E7). One example is **PDS0101**, a lipid-based nanoparticle vaccine containing HPV16 peptides. In an ongoing phase II trial (VERSATILE-002), combining PDS0101 with pembrolizumab in HPV-positive HNSCC appears to **boost efficacy** over pembrolizumab alone [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/august-10-2023/novel-hpv-targeted-agents-boost-efficacy-of-pembrolizumab-in-head-and-neck-cancer-two-studies-show/#:~:text=The%20phase%20II%20VERSATILE,1). Investigators report that PDS0101 can induce polyfunctional HPV-specific T cells and enhance anti-tumor immune memory [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/august-10-2023/novel-hpv-targeted-agents-boost-efficacy-of-pembrolizumab-in-head-and-neck-cancer-two-studies-show/#:~:text=The%20phase%20II%20VERSATILE,1), and early data show an “incremental benefit” in response rate for the vaccine + pembrolizumab combo [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/august-10-2023/novel-hpv-targeted-agents-boost-efficacy-of-pembrolizumab-in-head-and-neck-cancer-two-studies-show/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20excited%20about%20this,Minnesota%2C%20told%20The%20ASCO%20Post). Another novel agent, **CUE-101**, is a fusion protein that delivers interleukin-2 and an HPV16 E7 epitope to selectively activate HPV-specific CD8 T cells [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/august-10-2023/novel-hpv-targeted-agents-boost-efficacy-of-pembrolizumab-in-head-and-neck-cancer-two-studies-show/#:~:text=The%20second%20study%20was%20a,positive%20T%20cells). In a first-in-human trial, CUE-101 plus pembrolizumab showed some signs of activity in HPV-related cancers [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/august-10-2023/novel-hpv-targeted-agents-boost-efficacy-of-pembrolizumab-in-head-and-neck-cancer-two-studies-show/#:~:text=The%20second%20study%20was%20a,positive%20T%20cells). These immune-activating biologics are still in clinical trials, but they illustrate the next generation of immunotherapy beyond checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, **immunotherapy advancements** – from checkpoint blockers to vaccines and CAR T – are offering more personalized and potentially durable treatment options across head and neck cancer subtypes.

## Targeted and Small-Molecule Therapies

Targeted therapies act on specific molecular drivers of cancer growth. In head and neck cancer, the prototypical target has been the **epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)**, which is overexpressed in the majority of HNSCC. The EGFR inhibitor **cetuximab** was the first FDA-approved targeted drug in this disease and remains an important therapy. Cetuximab (a monoclonal antibody) added to radiation improves survival in locally advanced HNSCC and, combined with chemotherapy (the “EXTREME” regimen), modestly extends survival in recurrent/metastatic disease [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5678969/#:~:text=Despite%20improvements%20in%20treatment%2C%20survival,treatment%20regimens%20to%20improve%20outcome) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5678969/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20only%20six%20drugs,development%20of%20more%20effective%20drugs). However, not all patients benefit from cetuximab and resistance is common [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5678969/#:~:text=Current%20EGFR,improve%20efficacy%20and%20reduce%20toxicity) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5678969/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20only%20six%20drugs,development%20of%20more%20effective%20drugs). Researchers have therefore pursued new ways to target EGFR or overcome resistance. Small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib) were tested but yielded limited success in unselected patients. More recently, attention has turned to multi-targeted approaches and next-generation biologics.

A notable example is **petosemtamab (MCLA-158)**, a first-in-class **bispecific antibody** that targets EGFR *and* LGR5 (a cancer stem cell marker). Petosemtamab is designed to both inhibit EGFR signaling and trigger immune attack (via enhanced ADCC) against LGR5-expressing stem-like tumor cells [merus.nl](https://merus.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CT012_Cohen_AACR-2023_Oral_Peto-HNSCC_11Apr2023.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Clinical%20activity%20of%20MCLA,via%20LGR5%2FE3) [annalsofoncology.org](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534\(24\)04490-9/fulltext#:~:text=,arm%20cohort%20of%20petosemtamab). In an early-phase study, petosemtamab monotherapy showed encouraging activity in cetuximab-resistant HNSCC, and when combined with pembrolizumab as first-line therapy it produced a striking 67% response rate in PD-L1–positive HNSCC patients [ir.merus.nl](https://ir.merus.nl/news-releases/news-release-details/merus-petosemtamab-combination-pembrolizumab-interim-data#:~:text=,response%20rate) [ir.merus.nl](https://ir.merus.nl/news-releases/news-release-details/merus-petosemtamab-combination-pembrolizumab-interim-data#:~:text=,response%20rate). Based on this potential, the FDA granted **Breakthrough Therapy Designation** in early 2025 to petosemtamab + pembrolizumab for first-line recurrent/metastatic HNSCC [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-status-to-petosemtamab-pembrolizumab-in-hnscc#:~:text=,combination%20in%20this%20patient%20population) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-status-to-petosemtamab-pembrolizumab-in-hnscc#:~:text=patients%20with%20recurrent%20or%20metastatic,combination%20in%20this%20patient%20population). A phase III trial (LiGeR-HN1) is now underway to confirm its benefit [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-status-to-petosemtamab-pembrolizumab-in-hnscc#:~:text=,combination%20in%20this%20patient%20population) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-status-to-petosemtamab-pembrolizumab-in-hnscc#:~:text=match%20at%20L231%20In%20addition,with%20recurrent%20or%20metastatic%20HNSCC). If successful, this bispecific could become a new standard, representing a next-generation EGFR-targeted therapy with broader mechanism of action than cetuximab.

Beyond EGFR, researchers are identifying other **actionable mutations** in head and neck cancers for precision therapies. One emerging target is **HRAS**, an oncogene mutated in a subset of HNSCC (particularly some laryngeal and oral cavity tumors). The **farnesyltransferase inhibitor** **tipifarnib** blocks HRAS signaling and has demonstrated notable efficacy in HRAS-mutant HNSCC. In a phase II trial (AIM-HN), tipifarnib achieved disease control in 100% of evaluable patients with HRAS-mutant tumors (all had tumor shrinkage or stable disease) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/tipifarnib-yields-100-disease-control-in-hrasmutant-head-and-neck-squamous-cell--carcinoma#:~:text=The%20signal%20transduction%20inhibitor%20tipifarnib,Molecular%20Targets%20and%20Cancer%20Therapeutics) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/tipifarnib-yields-100-disease-control-in-hrasmutant-head-and-neck-squamous-cell--carcinoma#:~:text=The%20signal%20transduction%20inhibitor%20,1). Responses were especially deep in tumors with high mutant allele frequency. These results from an early conference report [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/tipifarnib-yields-100-disease-control-in-hrasmutant-head-and-neck-squamous-cell--carcinoma#:~:text=The%20signal%20transduction%20inhibitor%20tipifarnib,Molecular%20Targets%20and%20Cancer%20Therapeutics) have generated optimism that **targeting HRAS** could become the first molecularly targeted therapy for an HNSCC genetic subset. A registration-directed study is ongoing [oncologypro.esmo.org](https://oncologypro.esmo.org/meeting-resources/esmo-congress-2023/a-phase-ii-study-evaluating-tipifarnib-in-mhras-recurrent-or-metastatic-r-m-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-hnscc-aim-hn-study#:~:text=Mini%20oral%20session%20,HN%20study), and the FDA has granted tipifarnib **Breakthrough Therapy** designation for HRAS-mutant HNSCC (the agent is not yet approved, but could be if phase II/III results are confirmed).

Another precision target across solid tumors is **NTRK gene fusions**, which, while rare in head and neck cancer, have been identified in some salivary gland and thyroid malignancies and occasionally in HNSCC. Patients with NTRK fusions can be treated with TRK inhibitors like **larotrectinib** or **entrectinib**, which are FDA-approved **tumor-agnostic** therapies. Similarly, HNSCC tumors that are microsatellite instability–high (MSI-H) or tumor mutation burden–high (TMB ≥10) are uncommon but would be eligible for pembrolizumab under tissue-agnostic approvals. These cases highlight the importance of genomic testing to find infrequent but actionable alterations for **precision medicine**.

**Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs)** are another cutting-edge therapy entering head and neck oncology. ADCs consist of an antibody targeting a tumor antigen linked to a potent cytotoxic drug, thereby delivering chemotherapy directly to cancer cells. Several ADCs are in trials for HNSCC. For instance, **ozuriftamab vedotin** is an ADC targeting **ROR2** (a receptor often overexpressed in aggressive tumors) conjugated to the microtubule inhibitor MMAE. In mid-2024, the FDA granted this agent Fast Track designation for R/M HNSCC after chemotherapy and PD-1 failure [onclive.com](https://www.onclive.com/view/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-ozuriftamab-vedotin-in-recurrent-metastatic-hnscc#:~:text=Image). Early phase data showed **clinically meaningful activity** in heavily pretreated patients, with tumor responses observed and a manageable safety profile [onclive.com](https://www.onclive.com/view/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-ozuriftamab-vedotin-in-recurrent-metastatic-hnscc#:~:text=Ozuriftamab%20vedotin%20is%20a%20conditionally,resistance%20to%20chemotherapy%20and%20immunotherapy) [onclive.com](https://www.onclive.com/view/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-ozuriftamab-vedotin-in-recurrent-metastatic-hnscc#:~:text=The%20safety%20and%20efficacy%20of,refractory%20patients%20with%20HNSCC). Another ADC, **enfortumab vedotin** (which targets Nectin-4 and is approved in bladder cancer), achieved a 24% response rate in a phase II cohort of advanced head and neck cancer, including some durable responses [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/enfortumab-vedotin-elicits-compelling-data-in-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=Enfortumab%20Vedotin%20Elicits%20Compelling%20Data,202%20study) [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/enfortumab-vedotin-elicits-compelling-data-in-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=Patients%20with%20heavily%20pretreated%20head,202%20study). Researchers are also developing ADCs against EGFR (e.g. toxin-loaded anti-EGFR antibodies like MRG-003) to improve upon cetuximab by directly killing EGFR-expressing cells. Early-phase trials of an EGFR-targeted ADC in China have shown it is tolerable with signs of anti-tumor activity in HNSCC [aacrjournals.org](https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article/23/2/187/733943/An-Antibody-Drug-Conjugate-Directed-to-Tissue#:~:text=). The **promise of ADCs** is their ability to overcome resistance by delivering drugs intracellularly; multiple targets (EGFR, HER2, Tissue Factor, B7-H3, etc.) are under investigation with various payloads [ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/PO.24.00179#:~:text=,target%20antigens%2C%20payloads%2C%20and%20linkers) [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03600-2#:~:text=A%20B7H3,advanced%20solid%20tumors%2C%20particularly). While no ADC is approved yet for head and neck cancer, the preliminary results suggest they could become **valuable tools**, especially for patients who have exhausted immunotherapy and standard treatments.

Finally, **targeted radionuclide therapy** represents an experimental yet intriguing modality. This approach involves radiolabeling tumor-specific molecules (such as antibodies or small ligands) with radioactive isotopes to deliver focused radiation to cancer cells. A 2024 review notes that no radiopharmaceuticals are approved for HNSCC yet, but many targets (EGFR, HER2, CD44v6, fibroblast activation protein **FAP**, etc.) could be exploited for such therapies [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1445191/full#:~:text=alternative%20treatment%20options,growth%20factor%20receptor%20is%20a) [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1445191/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L448%20molecular%20markers,To%20develop%20radiopharmaceuticals%20leveraging). Early studies have looked at radiolabeled cetuximab for imaging and therapy [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1445191/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L839%20found%20that,small%20cell), and novel agents like FAP-targeted radionuclides (FAPI compounds) are being considered given FAP’s expression in tumor stroma [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1445191/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L776%20basis%20for,further%20in%20the%20next%20section) [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1445191/full#:~:text=basis%20for%20FAP%20targeting%20radiopharmaceuticals,further%20in%20the%20next%20section). While still in preclinical or phase I stages, **radio-conjugates** could in the future allow systemic radiation delivery to micro-metastases while sparing normal tissue, complementing external beam radiation. This is a frontier area requiring more research, but it exemplifies the breadth of **targeted therapy research** in head and neck cancer – ranging from molecular inhibitors and ADCs to entirely new modalities like radiopharmaceuticals.

## Precision Medicine and Combination Strategies

Because head and neck cancers are **heterogeneous**, a one-size treatment does not fit all. Precision medicine aims to tailor therapy to the individual tumor’s biology (and the patient’s needs) to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. One aspect of precision oncology in head and neck cancer is **biomarker-driven treatment selection**. For example, **PD-L1 expression (CPS score)** is now routinely tested in HNSCC and guides first-line immunotherapy decisions: patients with high PD-L1 (CPS ≥1 or ≥20) derive the most benefit from pembrolizumab alone [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=In%20the%20final%20analysis%20of,pembrolizumab%20was%20noninferior%20to%20chemotherapy), whereas low expressors may be steered toward combination pembrolizumab+chemotherapy or other regimens [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=targeted%20therapy%20,pembrolizumab%20was%20noninferior%20to%20chemotherapy) [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20data%20from%20KEYNOTE,the%202019%20ASCO%20Annual%20Meeting). **HPV status** is another critical biomarker – HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers have a much better prognosis than HPV-negative tumors [thegreenjournal.com](https://www.thegreenjournal.com/article/S0167-8140\(24\)00643-1/abstract#:~:text=De,a%20result%20of%20their). This has spurred **de-escalation trials** that *personalize treatment intensity* for HPV-associated disease. For instance, multiple studies (E.g. NRG Oncology HN002, ECOG-1308, Quarterback trial) have explored giving lower doses of radiation or using targeted agents instead of cisplatin for select HPV-positive patients. These trials have shown that **de-escalated therapy can maintain excellent tumor control** (in some series, ~90+% 2-year disease control) while significantly reducing long-term side effects [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/july-25-2023/quarterback-trial-de-escalation-of-chemoradiotherapy-for-subset-of-patients-with-hpv-positive-oropharyngeal-cancer/#:~:text=...%20ascopost.com%20%20De,risk%20oropharyngeal) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10413127/#:~:text=,toxicity%20while%20maintaining%20the). However, de-escalation must be done cautiously; some randomized data (like replacing cisplatin with cetuximab) unexpectedly showed worse survival [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23175-9_9#:~:text=Treatment%20De,have%20detrimental%20effects%20on%20survival). Ongoing precision approaches are now using risk stratification (HPV status, smoking history, tumor response to induction therapy, etc.) to identify which patients can safely get *less intense* treatment without compromising cure rates [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/may-10-2024/two-studies-support-deintensification-of-treatment-for-hpv-associated-oropharyngeal-cancer/#:~:text=...%20ascopost.com%20%20De,these%20patients%20are%20frequently) [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/15/2733#:~:text=De,also%20minimizing%20toxicity%20from%20treatment). This personalized deintensification is especially relevant to oropharyngeal cancer survivors, who are often younger and face decades of living with treatment-related speech, swallowing, and thyroid issues.

For **nasopharyngeal carcinoma**, **EBV DNA** in plasma serves as a unique biomarker to guide therapy. Persistently detectable or rising EBV DNA after standard chemoradiation predicts a high risk of relapse. Clinical trials from Asia have shown that giving adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with positive post-treatment EBV DNA significantly improves relapse-free survival, whereas those who clear the virus can be observed, thereby sparing some patients additional chemo. Monitoring EBV DNA allows a precision adjuvant approach – intensifying treatment only in those who need it. Likewise, NPC patients with extremely high pretreatment EBV DNA may benefit from adding newer agents (like immunotherapy) up front, a strategy being tested in trials.

Another pillar of precision medicine is **genomic profiling** to identify less common molecular targets as discussed (HRAS mutations, NTRK fusions, etc.). Multigene sequencing panels or trials like NCI-MATCH have occasionally matched head and neck cancer patients to targeted drugs (for example, an HNSCC with a rare MET amplification receiving a MET inhibitor, or PIK3CA-mutant tumors enrolling on PI3K inhibitor studies). While broad “basket trials” have had limited success in HNSCC due to relatively few targetable mutations, such testing can be lifesaving for the minority who have an actionable aberration. Moreover, comprehensive profiling can uncover **tumor suppressor alterations or gene expression signatures** that inform prognosis and potential experimental therapy choices (for instance, identifying an immune-cold tumor vs an inflamed one, to guide immunotherapy combinations).

**Combination therapy** strategies are central to head and neck cancer treatment, and new modalities are being integrated into multi-modality plans. Combining different treatments can have synergistic effects – for example, chemo and radiation together improve locoregional control (at the cost of higher toxicity). Now, combinations like **immunotherapy + radiation** are being explored. The rationale is that radiation may enhance tumor antigen release and T-cell infiltration, potentially boosting the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors. Trials adding durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) to standard chemoradiation in locally advanced HNSCC are ongoing, though one study replacing cisplatin with durvalumab during radiation showed that **cetuximab + radiation outperformed durvalumab + radiation** (2-year progression-free survival 64% vs 51%) in patients who couldn’t tolerate cisplatin [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/head-neck-cancer-cetuximab-versus-durvalumab#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20participants%20given,15%20along%20with%20radiation%20therapy) [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/head-neck-cancer-cetuximab-versus-durvalumab#:~:text=At%20a%20median%20follow,in%20the%C2%A0Lancet%20Oncology%C2%A0on%20November%2014). This result [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/head-neck-cancer-cetuximab-versus-durvalumab#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20participants%20given,15%20along%20with%20radiation%20therapy) underscores that not all combinations will succeed and that timing and patient selection are crucial. It appears concurrent immunotherapy with radiation may require additional immune priming or perhaps works better *after* radiation (to eradicate microscopic disease) than as a direct radiosensitizer. Research in this arena continues, including trials of **neoadjuvant immunotherapy** (before definitive chemoradiation or surgery) and **concurrent vs adjuvant immunotherapy**.

Another combination approach is **chemotherapy + immunotherapy**, which is already standard in the metastatic setting (e.g. pembrolizumab + platinum/5-FU). Chemotherapy can modulate the immune response by depleting immunosuppressive cells and making tumor cells more immunogenic, thereby complementing checkpoint blockade. There is also interest in **triplet combinations** such as chemo + immunotherapy + targeted agents. For example, ongoing trials are evaluating adding cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor) to pembrolizumab + chemo, or adding VEGF inhibitors to chemo-immunotherapy, to see if triple therapy can further improve outcomes in first-line treatment. Early-phase studies (e.g. combining pembrolizumab, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy in HNSCC) have shown feasibility and hints of higher response rates, but it remains to be seen if toxicity is acceptable and survival is improved enough to warrant triple therapy.

In summary, precision medicine efforts in head and neck cancer are guiding **who gets what treatment** (via biomarkers like PD-L1, HPV, EBV, gene mutations) and **how to best combine therapies**. The goal is to **personalize therapy intensity and components** – escalating treatment (adding new drugs or combinations) for those unlikely to be cured with standard therapy alone, and de-escalating (reducing treatment burden) for those likely to be cured with less. As our biological understanding deepens and more agents like immunotherapies and targeted drugs become available, the treatment paradigm is shifting from a uniform approach to a nuanced, individualized strategy.

## Subtype-Specific Highlights

While many emerging treatments apply across head and neck cancers, there are unique considerations for each subtype:

- **Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPSCC)** – A large proportion of oropharyngeal tumors are **HPV-positive**, which confer a better prognosis. This has led to trials of **de-intensification** (lower radiation doses or omitting chemotherapy) in HPV-associated OPSCC to spare patients long-term toxicities [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10413127/#:~:text=,toxicity%20while%20maintaining%20the). At the same time, HPV-positive cancers may be particularly immunogenic. Patients with OPSCC (HPV+ or HPV–) benefit from immunotherapy in the recurrent setting similarly to other HNSCC [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9887557/#:~:text=PMC%20pmc,chemotherapy%2C%20regardless%20of%20p16%20status). Additionally, **HPV-targeted therapies** are being developed: for example, therapeutic vaccines (PDS0101, ISA101, etc.) plus PD-1 inhibitors have shown enhanced immune responses and tumor control in early studies [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/august-10-2023/novel-hpv-targeted-agents-boost-efficacy-of-pembrolizumab-in-head-and-neck-cancer-two-studies-show/#:~:text=The%20phase%20II%20VERSATILE,1) [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/august-10-2023/novel-hpv-targeted-agents-boost-efficacy-of-pembrolizumab-in-head-and-neck-cancer-two-studies-show/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20excited%20about%20this,Minnesota%2C%20told%20The%20ASCO%20Post). If these trials succeed, future first-line therapy for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer might involve a checkpoint inhibitor together with an HPV vaccine or immune engager to achieve deeper responses. OPSCC patients were included in the KEYNOTE-689 trial, so **neoadjuvant pembrolizumab** may become part of surgery-based treatment for locally advanced cases [targetedonc.com](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/perioperative-pembrolizumab-betters-survival-in-stage-iii-iv-head-and-neck-cancer#:~:text=Perioperative%20pembrolizumab%20,689%20study%20%28NCT03765918%29.%5E%7B1). Overall, OPSCC is at the forefront of de-escalation and immunotherapy combination efforts due to the unique biology of HPV-mediated disease.
- **Laryngeal Cancer** – The primary goal in laryngeal carcinoma (especially advanced tumors) is often **organ preservation** – i.e. curing the cancer while preserving the voice box. Traditional organ-preservation therapy has been concurrent chemoradiation (instead of total laryngectomy surgery) with success in many patients. Emerging strategies are testing whether adding immunotherapy can improve organ preservation rates or outcomes. For instance, trials are evaluating **induction immunochemotherapy** (checkpoint inhibitor + chemotherapy before radiation) to maximally shrink tumors. A recent Chinese phase II study combined toripalimab with induction chemo for locally advanced laryngeal/hypopharyngeal cancers and reported a high response rate (>70% responded) that enabled successful larynx preservation in a majority of patients (publication pending). There is also an ongoing trial of **pembrolizumab-based organ preservation** (Pembrolizumab with chemo, followed by radiation for responders) [ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2023.41.16_suppl.TPS6111#:~:text=A%20single,locally%20advanced%20larynx%20cancers%3A). In the recurrent/metastatic setting, laryngeal cancer is treated as any HNSCC – PD-1 inhibitors have proven efficacy and are now standard after platinum therapy [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/improved-survival-shown-with-first-line-pembrolizumab-in-advanced-head-and-neck-cancer/#:~:text=In%20the%20final%20analysis%20of,pembrolizumab%20was%20noninferior%20to%20chemotherapy). No larynx-specific targeted drugs exist, but if a tumor harbors an actionable mutation (e.g. HRAS), precision therapy like tipifarnib could be applicable. Thus, the advances in immunotherapy and targeted agents broadly benefit laryngeal cancer, and special studies are underway to integrate these into **voice-preserving treatment protocols**.
- **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)** – NPC differs from other head/neck cancers in its viral etiology (EBV), endemic nature in certain regions, and high sensitivity to both radiation and chemotherapy. The major recent advance for NPC is the incorporation of **immunotherapy**. Based on the JUPITER-02 trial, the new standard for recurrent/metastatic NPC is **toripalimab with chemotherapy**, which significantly improved survival (median progression-free survival ~11.7 vs 8.0 months) [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=In%20one%20trial%2C%20people%20with,those%20who%20received%20chemotherapy%20alone) and led to the first FDA approval of an immunotherapy for NPC [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration,of%20head%20and%20neck%20cancer). Even in earlier stages, trials like CAPTAIN-1st (evaluating camrelizumab, another PD-1 inhibitor, with chemoradiation) suggest immunotherapy may enhance cure rates when added to definitive therapy, though this is still investigational. Another distinctive approach in NPC is **EBV-targeted therapy**: for example, trials have infused **EBV-specific T cells** in patients with relapsed NPC, and **vaccines targeting EBV proteins** (like LMP2) are being tested to stimulate immunity. A novel CAR T-cell therapy against the EBV antigen LMP1 is also in early trials for NPC [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10052000/#:~:text=phase%20I%20clinical%20trial%20of,the%20treatment%20of%20nasopharyngeal%20carcinoma). While these are nascent, the hope is to exploit the viral antigens as therapeutic targets. Additionally, combination strategies are very relevant in NPC – e.g. adding bevacizumab to immunotherapy (as described, yielded a remarkable ORR ~58% in refractory NPC) [ascopost.com](https://ascopost.com/news/february-2025/addition-of-bevacizumab-to-pembrolizumab-in-platinum-resistant-recurrent-or-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/#:~:text=Median%20follow,CI) or adding targeted agents to standard chemoradiation. Precision stratification by EBV DNA is used to personalize treatment intensity in many centers. In short, NPC is seeing **rapid integration of immunotherapy** into standard care and unique immune-based approaches leveraging its viral biology.

The table below summarizes and compares some **major emerging treatment strategies by subtype**, including the treatment modality, mechanism of action, approval status, and key clinical outcomes:

| Laryngeal | **Induction Chemo + Immunotherapy** – e.g. adding toripalimab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (investigational) | Immune checkpoint blockade combined with cytotoxic therapy | Phase II trials (organ preservation focus) | Aimed at maximal tumor shrinkage and voice box preservation; one study showed >70% response enabling larynx preservation in locally advanced cases (toripalimab + chemo). |
| **Nasopharyngeal** | **Toripalimab + Chemotherapy** – first-line systemic therapy for recurrent/metastatic NPC | PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor plus cytotoxic chemotherapy | **FDA-approved (2023)** for 1L R/M NPC [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration,of%20head%20and%20neck%20cancer) | Significantly improved outcomes: 3-year OS ~64% with combo vs 49% chemo alone; longer PFS and higher response rate (ORR ~63% vs 42% chemo) [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer#:~:text=In%20one%20trial%2C%20people%20with,those%20who%20received%20chemotherapy%20alone). |

## Conclusion

In summary, the treatment of head and neck cancers is rapidly evolving beyond conventional surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. **Immunotherapy** has emerged as a game-changer, with checkpoint inhibitors now standard in advanced HNSCC and NPC, and new combinations (dual checkpoints, vaccines, cellular therapies) showing promise to further improve responses. **Targeted therapies** are diversifying, from refinements in EGFR inhibition to novel agents against specific mutations (HRAS) or using modalities like ADCs and radiopharmaceuticals. These advances are increasingly subtype-specific: HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers see de-intensification and vaccine approaches, while nasopharyngeal carcinoma benefits from EBV-targeted strategies and anti-angiogenic combos. Underpinning all this is a trend toward **precision medicine**, tailoring treatment choices to tumor biology (PD-L1, HPV, EBV, gene profiles) and patient risk factors, and combining modalities in intelligent ways to maximize efficacy. Many of these emerging therapies – such as toripalimab for NPC or pembrolizumab for HNSCC – are now **FDA-approved and in clinical use**, whereas others are in trials but may become tomorrow’s standard of care. Ongoing clinical trials will further define optimal use of immunotherapy (e.g. in earlier stages or in combination), the role of new targeted agents, and how to best personalize therapy for each patient. The outlook for head and neck cancer patients is steadily improving as these cutting-edge treatments expand the options beyond the historical toolbox, offering hope for longer survival and better quality of life even in advanced disease.
