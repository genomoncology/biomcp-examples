  - Stimuli-responsive release mechanisms (pH, temperature, enzyme-triggered)

- **Nanotheranostics**: Combined diagnostic and therapeutic applications
  - Real-time imaging and drug delivery
  - Monitoring of treatment response
  - Personalized dosing based on tumor uptake

### Oncolytic Virotherapy
- Engineered viruses that selectively infect and kill cancer cells
- Potential to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses
- Examples in development for head and neck cancer:
  - Modified herpes simplex virus (T-VEC and derivatives)
  - Adenoviruses with tumor-specific promoters
  - Vaccinia virus-based platforms

### Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)
