# FDA Approval of Toripalimab for Nasopharyngeal Cancer

## Overview
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved toripalimab (Loqtorzi) as the first immunotherapy drug for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a type of head and neck cancer. This approval, announced on October 27, 2023, represents a significant advancement in the treatment of this rare cancer type.

## Key Details

### Approval Scope
- First approval of toripalimab in the United States
- Approved as initial treatment for people with NPC that has recurred or metastasized
- Also approved as monotherapy for people with recurrent or metastatic NPC that has progressed on or after standard chemotherapy

### Clinical Trial Evidence
The approval was based on results from two clinical trials conducted in Asia:

1. **JUPITER-02 Trial**:
   - Enrolled 289 people with recurrent or metastatic NPC
   - Compared toripalimab plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone
   - Results:
     - Median progression-free survival: 11.7 months (toripalimab group) vs. 8.0 months (chemotherapy only)
     - 2-year survival rate: 78% (toripalimab group) vs. 65% (chemotherapy alone)
     - 3-year survival rate: 64% (toripalimab group) vs. 49% (chemotherapy alone)
     - Median progression-free survival: 21.4 months vs. 8.2 months

2. **POLARIS-02 Trial**:
   - Early-phase trial conducted in hospitals in China
   - Enrolled 172 people with advanced NPC that had spread or worsened after chemotherapy
   - Results:
     - Toripalimab shrank tumors in 21% of patients
     - Median duration of response was almost 15 months

### Mechanism of Action
- Toripalimab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1 protein on immune cells
- By blocking PD-1, it allows immune cells to better attack and kill cancer cells

### Side Effects
- Most common side effects were due mainly to chemotherapy
- Immune-related side effects included:
  - Inflammation of the lungs and colon
  - Abnormal liver function
  - Skin reactions
  - Hormone problems such as underactive thyroid
- Side effects more common in the toripalimab group included:
  - Underactive thyroid
  - Upper respiratory tract infections
  - Pneumonia

## Significance
- Changes the standard of care for NPC patients in the United States
- Provides a new treatment option for a cancer that has limited therapeutic options
- Particularly important for a cancer type that is often excluded from clinical trials of head and neck cancer
