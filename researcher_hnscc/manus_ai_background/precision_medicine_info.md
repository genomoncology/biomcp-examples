# Precision Medicine Approaches for Head and Neck Cancer

## Overview
Precision medicine represents an emerging therapeutic approach focused on tailoring treatment for each individual patient with head and neck cancer. This discipline is based on the concept that prediction of clinical outcomes is more accurate when driven by analysis of features of single tumor heterogeneity, rather than by comparison between cohorts of patients.

## Key Approaches in Precision Medicine

### 1. Genomic Approach
- **Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)** techniques allow collection of large sets of omics data in a relatively simple and accessible way
- **Genotype-drug matching** has been demonstrated as a valid strategy in several tumor types
- **Biomarker-driven clinical trials** are exploring the efficacy of genotype-drug matching in head and neck cancer
  - The EORTC 1559 study (NCT03088059) compares the activity of targeted agents (afatinib, palbociclib, niraparib, and entrectinib) with immunotherapy
  - NGS technology is used to analyze copy number variations and somatic mutations of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes

### 2. Liquid Biopsy Technologies
- Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) through liquid biopsy technologies
- Compared to tissue samples, liquid biopsies are less invasive and can be performed more frequently
- Allows monitoring of ctDNA over time, making it a potential biomarker
- Applied in clinical evaluations for:
  - Prediction of patient outcomes
  - Selection of patients for personalized therapies
- The INSPIRE trial (NCT02644369) explores the correlation between ctDNA and clinical outcomes of patients treated with pembrolizumab, including head and neck cancer patients

### 3. Multi-Omics Approaches
- Head and neck cancers are characterized by complex and heterogeneous molecular profiles
- Multi-omics analysis integrates:
  - Epigenetics
  - Genomics
  - Metabolomics
  - Proteomics
- These analyses help characterize the molecular and genetic properties of individual tumors

### 4. Personalized Preclinical Platforms
- Development of personalized preclinical platforms using in vitro and in vivo techniques
- Testing behaviors and drug sensitivity of patient-derived samples
- 3D systems have been developed to reproduce tumor mass architecture:
  - Biomimetic scaffolds
  - Organoids
- In vivo models include patient-derived xenografts and zebrafish models

## Challenges and Limitations
- Biomarker-driven clinical trials still have limitations:
  - Narrow gene panels
  - Restrictive matching algorithms
  - Low matching rates
- Current precision medicine trials often don't consider combined treatment strategies
- Clinical trials based on personalized combined treatments are needed for head and neck cancers
