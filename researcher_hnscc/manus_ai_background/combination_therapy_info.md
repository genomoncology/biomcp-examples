# Combination Therapy Approaches for Head and Neck Cancer

## Overview
Combination therapy approaches have been developed for head and neck cancer to enhance locoregional disease control, reduce distant metastases, and preserve anatomic function. These multimodal strategies have evolved significantly over the past decades and now represent standard-of-care treatments for many patients with locally advanced disease.

## Chemoradiotherapy Combinations

### Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy (CCRT)
- Now established as a standard-of-care treatment for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
- Provides superior locoregional disease control and organ preservation compared to radiation alone
- Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACHNC) demonstrated an overall survival benefit of 6.5% at 5 years with CCRT
- Key chemotherapy agents used concurrently with radiation:
  - Cisplatin (most common, typically given every 3 weeks)
  - Carboplatin (alternative for patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin)
  - 5-Fluorouracil (5FU)
- RTOG 9111 study demonstrated superiority of CCRT in terms of locoregional disease control and larynx preservation
- GORTEC 94-01 trial showed improved local disease control and overall survival with carboplatin/5FU CCRT for oropharyngeal cancer

### Induction Chemotherapy (ICT)
- Involves administering chemotherapy before definitive local treatment (radiation or chemoradiation)
- Potential advantages include early treatment of micrometastatic disease and tumor downsizing
- More effective at reducing rates of distant metastasis than CCRT
- Evolution from cisplatin/5FU (PF) to docetaxel/cisplatin/5FU (TPF):
  - EORTC 24971/TAX 323 trial demonstrated improved overall survival with TPF compared to PF
  - TAX 324 trial showed improved locoregional and distant disease control with TPF
  - GORTEC 2000-01 confirmed improved disease response and larynx preservation with TPF

### Adjuvant Chemoradiation
- Used following surgical resection in high-risk patients
- EORTC 22931 and RTOG 9501 trials established the role of adjuvant chemoradiation
- Demonstrated improvement in locoregional disease control and progression-free survival
- High-risk features warranting adjuvant chemoradiation include:
  - Positive surgical margins
  - Extracapsular nodal extension
  - Multiple positive lymph nodes

## Novel Immunotherapy Combinations

### Eftilagimod Alpha + Pembrolizumab
- Eftilagimod alpha (efti) is a soluble LAG-3 fusion protein
- When combined with pembrolizumab (Keytruda), showed promising results in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC
- TACTI-003 (KEYNOTE-PNC-34) phase 2b trial demonstrated:
  - Overall response rate (ORR) of 35.5% in patients with negative PD-L1 expression
  - Complete response rate of 9.7%
  - Disease control rate of 58.1%
  - These results compare favorably to historic controls with anti-PD-1 monotherapy (5.4% ORR)
- Particularly significant for patients with low PD-L1 expression (CPS less than 1)
- Efti received FDA fast track designation for first-line treatment of HNSCC regardless of PD-L1 expression

## Challenges and Future Directions
- Optimal sequencing of multimodality therapy remains an area of active investigation
- Ongoing trials are exploring combinations of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation
- Treatment de-escalation strategies are being investigated for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers
- Personalized approaches based on biomarkers and tumor characteristics are emerging
