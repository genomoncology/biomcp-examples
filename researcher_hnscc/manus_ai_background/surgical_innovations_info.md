# Surgical Innovations for Head and Neck Cancer

## Overview
Surgical innovations for head and neck cancer have focused on improving both oncologic and functional outcomes for patients. Recent advances in technology and surgical techniques have allowed for improved treatment results while minimizing morbidity and preserving quality of life.

## Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS)

### Background and Development
- Approved by the FDA for head and neck surgery in 2009
- Now offered at many major cancer centers across the United States
- Developed in response to the rising incidence of oropharyngeal cancer, particularly HPV-related cases
- Represents a shift back toward surgical treatment after a period when non-surgical approaches (chemotherapy and radiation) were predominant

### Advantages and Applications
- Allows surgeons to remove hard-to-reach tumors through the mouth
- Avoids the morbidity of previous surgical approaches that often required dividing the jaw
- Particularly valuable for cancers of the oropharynx (tonsils and base of tongue)
- Results in:
  - Faster operative times
  - Shorter hospital stays
  - Improved functional outcomes for patients
  - No sacrifice of oncologic success

### Clinical Benefits
- Enables more accurate staging of cancers
- Allows for avoidance or decreased doses of radiation and/or chemotherapy
- Clinical trials are exploring additional treatment de-escalation following TORS
- Early results show promise for further reduction of treatment side effects and improvement of functional outcomes

## 3D Planning for Optimized Reconstruction

### Background
- While surgical removal techniques for advanced oral cavity cancers haven't changed significantly in recent decades, reconstruction capabilities have advanced greatly
- Free tissue transfer for head and neck reconstruction (developed in late 70s/early 80s) is now the standard of care
- Success rates exceed 95% for tissue transfer survival

### Advanced Microvascular Techniques
- Allows for transfer of virtually any type of tissue (skin, fascia, muscle, bone, nerves)
- Transferred tissue includes designated arteries and veins that can be connected to a new blood supply
- Enables the transferred tissue to take on a new life in the head and neck
- Can replace removed structures such as tongue, jaw, etc.

### 3D Computer Modeling and Printing
- Three-dimensional computer models created based on CT or MRI scans
- Enables surgeons to:
  - Pre-plan surgical cuts around a tumor
  - Plan and design the reconstruction weeks before surgery
  - 3D print models that can be sterilized and used during surgery
  - Use the models as a three-dimensional road map for pinpoint accuracy

### Benefits of 3D Planning
- Shortens time under general anesthesia
- Improves patient outcomes
- Serves as a patient education tool
- Allows for improved preoperative understanding
- Empowers patients to have a more active role in their cancer care
