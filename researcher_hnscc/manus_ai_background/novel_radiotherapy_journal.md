# Novel Unconventional Radiotherapy Techniques for Head and Neck Cancer

## Overview
Novel unconventional radiotherapy techniques represent significant advancements in the field of radiation oncology, offering improved treatment effectiveness and reduced complication rates through high-precision tumor identification, localization, and dose delivery. These innovative approaches are particularly valuable for patients with complex clinical scenarios, such as those with unresectable bulky tumors who may not be suitable candidates for conventional radio-chemotherapy.

## Spatially Fractionated Radiotherapy (SFRT) Approaches

### GRID Radiotherapy
- Challenges classical dogmas in conventional radiotherapy by using highly spatial dose modulation
- Divides the radiation field into smaller subsections of open and closed fields using a "grid" pattern
- Creates regions of high dose ("peaks") and regions of low dose ("valleys")
- Allows for much higher skin dose tolerance by sparing some areas
- Enables delivery of high radiation doses (15-20 Gy in a single fraction) to specific areas within tumors
- Particularly effective for bulky, unresectable tumors
- For head and neck cancers, GRID can increase the overall response rate by 10% compared to standard treatment
- More than 400 patients have been treated with GRID radiotherapy according to published data

### LATTICE Radiotherapy (LRT)
- Built upon the clinical experience of GRID SFRT
- Delivers an array of high dose islands (vertices) within the gross target volume using 3D configurations
- Creates peak-valley-like, highly heterogeneous dose distribution
- Effectively minimizes dose outside of the target volume
- Implemented using modern radiation delivery systems with intensity/arc-modulated focused photon beams or charged particle beams
- Can be readily implemented in any facility with a stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy (SRS/SBRT) program
- More than 25 radiation therapy centers worldwide are currently using LATTICE radiotherapy for their patients
- Clinical objectives include dose boosting, tumor radiation-debulking, and mediating anti-tumor bystander/abscopal effects

## Biological Mechanisms and Advantages

### Immunomodulation
- These novel approaches can promote immunological upregulation to help with cell killing
- Involves both cytokine and cell-mediated immune responses
- Can induce local bystander and distant abscopal effects to help shrink large masses

### Improved Tissue Tolerance
- A significant increase in normal tissue dose tolerances has been observed in both clinical trials and animal experiments
- Tumor control effectiveness is maintained or even enhanced in some configurations compared with conventional radiotherapy

## Clinical Applications
- Particularly valuable for unresectable bulky tumors that remain unsuitable for conventional radio-chemotherapy
- For palliative treatment, GRID radiotherapy has shown a 78% overall response, 20% complete response, and 73% mass effect response rate
- Used in definitive treatment of head and neck cancers and sarcomas
