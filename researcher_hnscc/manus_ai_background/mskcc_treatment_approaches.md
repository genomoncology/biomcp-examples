# Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Approaches to Head and Neck Cancer Treatment

## Overview
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is a leading institution specializing in cancer treatment, including head and neck cancers. Their multidisciplinary approach focuses not only on treating the cancer but also on maintaining quality of life for patients.

## Treatment Approaches

### Surgery
- Surgery is a typical treatment for head and neck cancer
- Some tumors can be removed with minimally invasive procedures:
  - Laser microsurgery
  - Robotic approaches
  - Mohs surgery
- Complex head and neck cancer operations require careful preparation and planning
- MSKCC surgeons use specialized techniques to preserve appearance and key functions such as speech and swallowing
- Treatment is provided by board-certified head and neck surgeons with extensive experience

### Radiation Therapy
- Radiation can cure many people with head and neck cancer
- MSKCC radiation oncologists use advanced technologies including:
  - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
  - Proton therapy
- These specialized approaches help prevent side effects, particularly those affecting eating or swallowing

### Immunotherapy
- Considered one of the most promising treatments for advanced head and neck cancer
- Uses the power of the patient's own immune system to fight cancer
- MSKCC offers close collaboration between doctors and scientists to develop new approaches
- May not be suitable for all patients
- Clinical trials testing new head and neck therapies may provide additional options for patients whose cancer has returned after standard treatment

### Personalized Medicine and Genomic Testing
- Personalized medicine approaches are particularly relevant for:
  - Stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer
  - Recurrent head and neck cancer
- Involves examining genetic mutations in cancer cells from biopsies
- Certain chemotherapy drugs are more effective against tumors with specific mutations
- MSKCC offers MSK-IMPACT®, a sophisticated genomic-sequencing test available exclusively to their patients
- MSK-IMPACT® helps identify genetic mutations and other abnormalities associated with specific cancers
- Results can help rule out ineffective treatments and identify appropriate clinical trials

### HPV-Associated Head and Neck Cancer Treatment
- HPV-positive tumors often respond very well to treatment
- Patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancer have a better prognosis
- May be eligible for less-intensive treatment plans, which can help prevent side effects without affecting cure rates
- Some patients may be able to avoid surgery entirely with reduced radiation doses

### Specialized Programs for Rare Head and Neck Cancers
MSKCC has dedicated programs for rare head and neck cancers:
1. Rare Salivary Gland Cancer Program
2. Rare Thyroid Cancer Program
3. Rare Skin Cancers of the Head and Neck Program

## Multidisciplinary Approach
- More than 80 medical professionals are part of MSKCC's head and neck cancer team
- The team meets weekly to discuss each patient's care plan
- Experts consider all available treatment options to develop the best approach for each individual
