# Immunotherapy Approaches for Head and Neck Cancer

## Overview
Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment approach for head and neck cancers, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). These treatments work by harnessing the body's immune system to target and fight cancer cells, often with fewer devastating side effects compared to conventional treatments.

## Current FDA-Approved Immunotherapies

### Checkpoint Inhibitors
- **Nivolumab (Opdivo®)**: A PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitor approved for subsets of patients with advanced head and neck cancer
- **Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®)**: A PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitor approved for subsets of patients with advanced head and neck cancer, including as a first-line therapy
- **Dostarlimab (Jemperli)**: A PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitor approved for subsets of patients with advanced head and neck cancer that has DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)

### Targeted Antibodies
- **Cetuximab (Erbitux®)**: A monoclonal antibody targeting the EGFR pathway; approved for subsets of patients with advanced head and neck cancer, including as a first-line therapy

## Emerging Immunotherapy Approaches

### Novel Combinations
- **Eftilagimod alpha + pembrolizumab**: This combination has shown promise in treating head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, even in patients who have not responded to other treatments
- **Ultra-low dose nivolumab**: Studies in India have found that an ultra-low dose of nivolumab helped people with advanced head and neck cancer live longer

### Targets Under Investigation
Several pathways and targets are being investigated in clinical trials:
- **DLL/Notch**: A pathway that can promote cell growth
- **EGFR**: A pathway that controls cell growth and is often mutated in cancer
- **FGF/FGF-R**: A pathway that controls cell growth, death, and migration
- **HER2**: A pathway that controls cell growth and is commonly overexpressed in cancer and associated with metastasis
- **TROP2**: A protein that is commonly overexpressed in cancer and appears to aid cancer cell self-renewal, proliferation, invasion, and survival
- **VEGF/VEGF-R**: A pathway that can promote blood vessel formation in tumors
- **EpCAM**: A pathway that controls cell growth and adhesion
- **Nectin-4**: A pathway that controls cell growth and adhesion

## Relevance to HPV-Related Head and Neck Cancers
Immunotherapy has shown particular promise for HPV-positive head and neck cancers, which have a unique risk profile and generally more favorable prognosis than tobacco or alcohol-induced HNSCC.
