# ASCO Guidelines on Immunotherapy and Biomarker Testing for Head and Neck Cancer

## Overview
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has developed evidence-based guidelines on immunotherapy and biomarker testing for recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancers. These guidelines provide recommendations for practicing physicians and other healthcare providers to optimize treatment decisions and patient outcomes.

## Purpose
To provide evidence-based recommendations for practicing physicians and other healthcare providers on immunotherapy and biomarker testing for head and neck cancers.

## Development Process
- ASCO convened an Expert Panel of medical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology, pathology, and patient advocacy experts
- The panel conducted a comprehensive literature search, including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 2000 through 2022
- Outcomes of interest included survival, overall response, and locoregional control
- Expert Panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations

## Key Information
- Published online: December 15, 2022
- DOI: 10.1200/JCO.22.02328
- Current guideline status (as of February 11, 2025)
- Developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts in head and neck cancer

## Significance
These guidelines represent the most current evidence-based recommendations for the use of immunotherapy and biomarker testing in the management of recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancers. They help clinicians make informed decisions about:

1. When to use immunotherapy agents
2. Which patients are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy
3. How to incorporate biomarker testing into treatment planning
4. Appropriate sequencing of therapies
