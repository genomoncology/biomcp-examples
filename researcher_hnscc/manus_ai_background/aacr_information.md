# American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Information on Head and Neck Cancer

## Overview
The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) provides valuable information about head and neck cancers, which are malignancies that arise in the nasal cavity, sinuses, lips, mouth, salivary glands, throat, or larynx. These cancers typically begin in the squamous cells that line the moist mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose, and throat.

## Epidemiology
According to the National Cancer Institute data cited by AACR:
- Approximately 71,100 people in the United States will receive a diagnosis of cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx in 2024
- About 16,110 people will die from these diseases
- These cancers are nearly twice as common among men as they are among women

## Types of Head and Neck Cancers
Head and neck cancers are categorized by the area in which they begin:
- Hypopharyngeal Cancer
- Laryngeal Cancer
- Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer
- Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary
- Nasopharyngeal Cancer
- Oropharyngeal Cancer
- Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer
- Salivary Gland Cancer

## Risk Factors
The AACR highlights the following major risk factors:
1. Alcohol use
2. Tobacco use
3. Infection with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV)

## Survival Statistics
- Approximately 69 percent of people diagnosed with cancer of the oral cavity or pharynx will survive five years or longer from their diagnosis
- For cancer of the larynx, the five-year survival rate is about 61 percent
- The AACR notes that survival statistics cannot predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient, as treatment and responses can vary greatly
