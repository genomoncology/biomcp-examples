## “LLM‑as‑Judge” Prompt  

> **TASK:** Compare, contrast, and force‑rank EXAMPLES A–E.  
>  • Create a rubric that *prioritises* **accuracy, clarity, and comprehensiveness**.  
>  • Add 3–5 additional comparison aspects.  
>  • Grade each example in tables, call out significant inaccuracies or omissions, and provide a final ranked list with reasoning.

The full judge prompt (above) was given verbatim to three large‑language models acting as reviewers. Their write‑ups live in **`evals/`**:

| Judge | File |
|-------|------|
| Claude 3.7 | [`evals/claude_37.md`](./evals/claude_37.md) |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | [`evals/gemini_2_5_pro.md`](./evals/gemini_2_5_pro.md) |
| OpenAI o3 | [`evals/openai_o3.md`](./evals/openai_o3.md) |
| *o3 summary* | [`evals/summary_o3.md`](./evals/summary_o3.md) |

Each judge independently built its own rubric, scored the five answers, highlighted factual slips, and produced a forced ranking.

## TL;DR of the Judge Consensus ★

1. **Example E** — Widest scope, best structure, but note minor approval mis‑statements (dostarlimab).  
2. **Example A** — Deep immuno/targeted coverage & citations; lighter on radiation/surgical advances.  
3. **Example C** — Extremely comprehensive (incl. gene/virus therapy); dense prose, a few minor slips.  
4. **Example B** — Readable overview; shallower evidence & fewer citations.  
5. **Example D** — Concise executive summary; least comprehensive overall.
