# **Emerging Treatment Strategies for Head and Neck Cancer**

The management of head and neck cancer is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a deeper understanding of the disease's molecular underpinnings and technological advancements across various therapeutic modalities. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging treatment strategies for head and neck cancer, encompassing recent progress in immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, surgery, combination approaches, personalized medicine, and novel gene and virus-based therapies.

## **Introduction**

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a significant global health challenge, accounting for approximately 3 to 5 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.1 The global incidence is also substantial, with an estimated 890,000 new cases reported in 2018\.1 Despite advancements in treatment, over 50 percent of patients with HNSCC are diagnosed at locally advanced or metastatic stages (III or IV), where the survival rate remains at a challenging 40 to 50 percent.2 The complex anatomy of the head and neck region means that treatment can significantly impact essential human functions such as speaking, swallowing, and facial expression, underscoring the need for therapies that are not only effective in eradicating the cancer but also in preserving these critical aspects of life.1 Traditional treatment approaches, primarily involving surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, while often effective in early-stage disease, face limitations in advanced cases, including insufficient efficacy and significant toxicities.1 This has spurred intensive research into innovative strategies that offer improved outcomes and reduced side effects.

The landscape of head and neck cancer therapy is rapidly evolving, with a notable shift towards personalized medicine, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies.4 The increasing adoption of biomarker-based therapies and diagnostics is allowing for more tailored treatment approaches based on the specific characteristics of an individual's tumor.5 Technological advancements in radiation therapy and surgical techniques are also playing a crucial role in enhancing precision and minimizing invasiveness.4 Furthermore, novel therapeutic agents such as gene therapies and oncolytic viruses are being explored for their potential to offer new treatment avenues, particularly for refractory or advanced disease.7 These emerging strategies reflect a broader movement towards more precise, less invasive, and biologically driven treatments, fueled by an expanding understanding of cancer biology and continuous technological innovation.

## **Advancements in Immunotherapy**

Immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative treatment modality for various cancers, including head and neck cancer. By harnessing the power of the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, immunotherapy offers the potential for durable responses and improved survival rates, particularly in advanced stages of the disease.

### **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors**

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown significant promise in the treatment of head and neck cancer, particularly those targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo) are both FDA-approved immunotherapies for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC whose cancer has progressed after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.1 These drugs work by blocking the PD-1 receptor on immune cells, which helps to activate the body's immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.10 Pembrolizumab has also gained approval as a first-line treatment option for metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 at a certain level.1 Another checkpoint inhibitor, dostarlimab (Jemperli), which also targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, is approved for the treatment of advanced HNSCC in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR).1

Clinical trials are actively investigating the potential benefits of combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with other immunomodulators, such as CTLA-4 inhibitors like ipilimumab and relatlimab. Early findings from neoadjuvant settings suggest that these combinations can lead to increased response rates and improved survival benefits.1 Eftilagimod alpha (efti), a soluble LAG-3 protein, has also shown promising results in combination with pembrolizumab, even in patients with low levels of PD-L1 expression, suggesting a potential to improve immunotherapy responses in a broader patient population.7

### **Cancer Vaccines**

The development of cancer vaccines represents another emerging strategy in the immunotherapy landscape for head and neck cancer. These vaccines are designed to elicit a specific immune response against tumor-associated antigens, encouraging the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. BNT113 is an investigational mRNA-based cancer vaccine currently being developed for the treatment of recurrent and metastatic HPV16-positive HNSCC. Its mechanism of action involves stimulating an immune response against the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins, thereby enhancing T-cell activity to target and eliminate cancer cells.10 Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab.10

Other vaccine-based immunotherapies under investigation include Versamune HPV, which is being tested in combination with PDS01ADC and bintrafusp alfa for the treatment of advanced HPV-associated cancers.17 EVM14 is another investigational mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine that targets tumor-associated antigens and has shown preclinical promise for head and neck cancer, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.15 Additionally, ISA101, a long-peptide vaccine that targets the HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins, is being evaluated in clinical trials both in combination with nivolumab and with a regimen of chemoradiotherapy and pembrolizumab for patients with HPV-associated HNSCC.16

### **Cell-Based Therapies**

Cell-based therapies, such as adoptive cell transfer and CAR T-cell therapy, are also being explored as potential treatment strategies for head and neck cancer.1 These therapies involve using a patient's own immune cells, which are then modified or expanded outside the body before being reinfused to target and destroy cancer cells. KSQ Therapeutics has received FDA clearance to begin clinical trials of a CRISPR-edited tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, KSQ-004EX, for advanced solid tumors, including HNSCC.19 Another CRISPR-edited TIL therapy developed by the same company, KSQ-001EX, is also in Phase 1/2 trials for the treatment of HNSCC.19 These approaches leverage the power of genetically modified immune cells to enhance their anti-cancer activity.

### **Combination Immunotherapy Strategies**

Given the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and the potential for resistance to single-agent immunotherapies, researchers are increasingly investigating combination immunotherapy strategies. Combining ICIs with other immunomodulating agents, such as LAG-3 inhibitors, has shown early success in improving immunotherapy responses in HNSCC.7 Clinical trials are also evaluating the combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies to potentially enhance anti-tumor immunity.1 Furthermore, the combination of Versamune HPV with PDS01ADC and bintrafusp alfa has demonstrated clinical benefits in advanced HPV-associated cancers.17 A phase 2/3 clinical trial (FORTIFI-NH01) is currently testing the efficacy of ficerafusp alfa, a bifunctional antibody targeting both EGFR and TGFβ, in combination with pembrolizumab for patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV-negative HNSCC.20

### **Biomarkers for Immunotherapy Response**

Identifying reliable biomarkers to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy is a critical area of research in head and neck cancer. PD-L1 expression, measured by the Combined Positive Score (CPS), is currently an important biomarker used to predict response to pembrolizumab.1 Tumour Mutational Burden (TMB), which reflects the number of mutations in a tumor's DNA, is also emerging as a potential biomarker that may predict response to ICIs.2 Researchers are also investigating other potential biomarkers, including PD-L2, IFN-γ, EGFR, VEGF, TGF-β, CD73, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), to further refine patient selection and understand mechanisms of resistance.23

## **Developments in Targeted Therapy**

Targeted therapy involves the use of drugs that target specific molecules or pathways involved in cancer cell growth and survival. In head and neck cancer, several targeted therapies have shown promise, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities.

### **EGFR Inhibitors**

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in head and neck cancers, making it a key therapeutic target. Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an approved monoclonal antibody that targets the EGFR pathway and is used in the treatment of advanced HNSCC.1 ASP-1929 is a novel photoimmunotherapy that consists of cetuximab conjugated to a light-activated dye, allowing for selective targeting and destruction of EGFR-expressing cancer cells.10 Clinical trials are actively evaluating the combination of cetuximab with other therapies, including immunotherapies and radiation therapy, to enhance treatment outcomes.7 Research is also ongoing to develop novel EGFR inhibitors and strategies to overcome resistance to existing EGFR-targeted therapies.38

### **Targeting Other Pathways**

Beyond EGFR, other molecular pathways are being explored as potential therapeutic targets in head and neck cancer. Tipifarnib, an inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, has shown promise in treating HNSCC with *HRAS* mutations.43 In certain salivary gland cancers that overexpress the HER2 protein, targeted therapies such as trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine have demonstrated activity.56 For salivary gland cancers with specific *NTRK* gene changes, TRK inhibitors like larotrectinib and entrectinib are being used.46 The VEGF/VEGF-R pathway, which promotes blood vessel formation in tumors, is also being targeted in various clinical trials for head and neck cancer.1

### **Targeted Therapy for Specific Subtypes**

Specific subtypes of head and neck cancer, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and salivary gland cancer, have unique molecular characteristics that are being targeted therapeutically. Toripalimab, an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, is used in combination with chemotherapy for patients with platinum-sensitive metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.17 Cetuximab may also be used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.36 In adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands, PRMT5 inhibitors have shown potential as a targeted therapy.59 Additionally, androgen receptor targeting agents, such as bicalutamide and leuprolide, are used in some salivary gland cancers that express the androgen receptor.56

### **Biomarkers for Targeted Therapy Response**

The effectiveness of targeted therapies is often linked to the presence of specific biomarkers in a patient's tumor. For example, the presence of *HRAS* mutations can predict response to tipifarnib 43, while HER2 expression is a biomarker for the use of trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine.56 Similarly, *NTRK* gene changes indicate potential benefit from larotrectinib and entrectinib 56, and androgen receptor expression guides the use of bicalutamide and leuprolide.56 CDKN2A alterations are also being investigated as a potential biomarker for response to the combination of palbociclib and cetuximab in certain head and neck cancers.54

## **Innovations in Radiation Therapy**

Radiation therapy continues to be a critical component in the management of head and neck cancer, and significant innovations in this field are aimed at improving its precision, efficacy, and safety.

### **Proton Therapy**

Proton therapy is an advanced form of radiation therapy that utilizes protons, rather than X-rays, to deliver radiation to tumors. The unique physical properties of protons allow for a more precise dose delivery, with most of the energy deposited at a specific depth known as the Bragg peak, thereby sparing surrounding healthy tissues.60 Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is a sophisticated technique that allows for highly conformal dose distributions, particularly beneficial for tumors in complex anatomical locations like the head and neck.60

A recent multi-institutional Phase III clinical trial led by MD Anderson Cancer Center compared IMPT with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancer. The results showed that IMPT achieved similar progression-free survival rates as IMRT but with a significant reduction in malnutrition and dependence on feeding tubes.60 Furthermore, a study involving over 60,000 patients with HNSCC found that proton therapy was associated with better overall and cancer-specific survival rates, as well as lower rates of locoregional recurrence, compared to IMRT.77 Additionally, research suggests that proton therapy may reduce the production of exosomes by cancer cells, which could potentially lead to a decrease in immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment.61

### **FLASH Radiation Therapy**

FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) is an emerging and potentially revolutionary technique that delivers radiation at ultra-high dose rates (greater than 40 Gy per second) in less than a second.78 Preclinical studies have indicated that FLASH-RT can significantly reduce normal tissue toxicity compared to conventional radiation therapy without compromising its anti-tumor efficacy.78 The first-in-human clinical trial (FAST-01), conducted in patients with bone cancer, demonstrated that FLASH-RT was safe and appeared to be as effective as conventional radiation in providing pain relief, without causing unexpected side effects.85 Penn Medicine is at the forefront of research in FLASH proton radiotherapy and is aiming to launch human clinical trials for head and neck cancer.82 The FLASHDEEP project is also exploring the combination of upright patient positioning with FLASH radiotherapy delivery.88

### **Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy**

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced radiation technique that uses computer-controlled linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to tumors while minimizing the dose to surrounding healthy tissues.5 Recent advancements in IMRT include the ability to perform selective dose escalation to the most radioresistant parts of the tumor and to further avoid critical substructures of organs at risk, often guided by functional imaging.90 Studies have shown that the increasing use of IMRT is associated with improved survival outcomes in patients with HNSCC.101 Furthermore, researchers are developing auto-planning tools that utilize artificial intelligence to optimize IMRT treatment plans, potentially improving planning quality and reducing planning time.93

### **Adaptive Radiation Therapy**

Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is a strategy that involves re-planning the radiation treatment during the course of therapy to account for changes in the patient's anatomy, such as tumor shrinkage or weight loss.4 ART can be categorized as anatomy-adapted ART (A-ART), which focuses on structural changes, or response-adapted ART (R-ART), which adjusts treatment based on how the tumor responds.103 A-ART aims to reduce overdosage of sensitive organs and improve the uniformity of the radiation dose to the target volume.99 R-ART may involve escalating the dose to areas of persistent disease or de-escalating the dose to normal tissues in cases of good tumor response.103 Clinical trials are also investigating the use of daily adaptive radiation therapy, utilizing technologies like Varian's Ethos system, to determine if it can reduce side effects such as xerostomia by allowing for smaller treatment margins.107

## **Minimally Invasive Surgical Approaches**

Minimally invasive surgical techniques have revolutionized the treatment of many cancers, including those of the head and neck, by offering the potential for less morbidity and faster recovery.

### **Transoral Robotic Surgery**

Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is a minimally invasive surgical approach that utilizes robotic instruments inserted through the mouth to access and remove tumors in the head and neck region.3 TORS is particularly useful for treating cancers of the oropharynx, including those associated with HPV infection.3 Compared to traditional open surgical procedures, TORS offers several benefits, including reduced pain and scarring, fewer complications, shorter hospital stays, and improved functional outcomes related to breathing, speaking, and swallowing.111 An ASCO guideline now supports the use of TORS in the multidisciplinary management of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.115 Mayo Clinic has also reported an increasing use of single-port robotic systems for treating head and neck cancers that were once considered inoperable.111

### **Endoscopic Surgery**

Endoscopic surgery represents another minimally invasive approach for treating head and neck cancers. This technique involves the use of endoscopes, which are long, thin tubes with a light and camera attached, to visualize and remove tumors through natural openings such as the mouth or nose, often without the need for external incisions.4 Advancements in visualization technologies, such as exoscopy, which provides magnified views of the surgical field, and augmented reality, which overlays critical anatomical structures onto the surgeon's view, are enhancing the precision of these procedures.4 Intraoperative imaging methods are also improving the ability of surgeons to accurately detect tumor margins during minimally invasive surgery.4

### **Advantages and Disadvantages**

Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer numerous advantages over traditional open surgery, including reduced trauma to the patient, less blood loss, smaller scars, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.5 Robotic surgery, in particular, provides surgeons with greater precision, dexterity, and control, especially when operating in hard-to-reach areas.120 However, minimally invasive surgery can also have disadvantages, such as longer operating times and the need for specialized training and equipment.122 Furthermore, the suitability of these techniques may be limited by factors such as tumor size, location, and the patient's overall health.

## **Novel Combination Therapies**

The integration of different treatment modalities is a key area of focus in head and neck cancer research, with the goal of achieving synergistic effects and improving patient outcomes.

### **Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy Combinations**

Combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy has become a significant strategy, especially in the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer. Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy is now a first-line standard of care for patients with metastatic HNSCC.1 Neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, such as the combination of nivolumab and chemotherapy, followed by response-adaptive chemoradiation, has shown promising results in treating advanced HPV-negative HNSCC.156 Numerous clinical trials are currently underway to investigate various chemotherapy and immunotherapy combinations in both locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic settings of head and neck cancer.2

### **Radiation and Immunotherapy Combinations**

The combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy, often referred to as radioimmunotherapy, is another area of intense investigation for the treatment of recurrent and metastatic HNSCC.18 Preclinical studies have suggested that combining these modalities can lead to synergistic effects and potentially overcome radioresistance.34 Clinical trials are evaluating the combination of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with checkpoint inhibitors to enhance both local and systemic anti-tumor responses.52 The ISA101 vaccine is also being studied in combination with radiotherapy, cisplatin, and pembrolizumab for HPV-associated HNSCC.16

### **Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy Combinations**

Combining targeted therapies with immunotherapies represents a rational approach to enhance treatment efficacy in head and neck cancer. Clinical trials are exploring the combination of EGFR inhibitors, such as cetuximab, with various immunotherapies to potentially modulate the tumor microenvironment and improve immune responses.7 Pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial.179 Additionally, the combination of petosemtamab, an antibody targeting EGFR, with pembrolizumab has shown early efficacy in patients with PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.15

### **Novel Combination Therapies in Clinical Trials**

Numerous other novel combination therapies are currently being investigated in clinical trials for head and neck cancer. The phase 2/3 FORTIFI-NH01 trial is testing the combination of ficerafusp alfa, which inhibits both EGFR and TGFβ, with pembrolizumab for patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV-negative HNSCC.20 A platform study (NCI-2025-00832) is evaluating multiple novel combinations, including the combination of domvanalimab and zimberelimab with chemotherapy, as first-line treatments for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.164 The TACTI-003 trial is assessing the efficacy of eftilagimod alpha in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.15

## **Personalized Medicine in Head and Neck Cancer**

Personalized medicine, which involves tailoring treatment strategies to the individual characteristics of a patient's disease, is becoming increasingly important in the management of head and neck cancer.

### **Biomarker-Driven Therapies**

Treatment decisions in head and neck cancer are increasingly being guided by the genetic, epigenetic, and protein markers present in a patient's tumor.1 HPV and EBV status are particularly important in risk stratification and predicting treatment response 1). Epigenetic biomarkers, such as DNA methylation patterns and microRNAs, are also being investigated for their potential to predict prognosis and response to therapy.183 The DART 2.0 clinical trial at Mayo Clinic is seeking to advance precision medicine for HPV-driven head and neck cancers by evaluating a blood-based biomarker.287

### **Liquid Biopsy**

Liquid biopsy, which involves the analysis of biomarkers in blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids, offers a minimally invasive approach to understanding the molecular characteristics of head and neck cancers.4 This technique allows for the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and viral DNA (HPV, EBV), which can aid in diagnosis and monitoring of the disease.200 Liquid biopsies have the potential for earlier detection of recurrence compared to traditional imaging methods 200 and can be used to monitor a patient's response to treatment and identify mechanisms of resistance.200 The levels of ctDNA and their clearance during treatment have also shown prognostic value.200 Saliva-based liquid biopsies offer a convenient and non-invasive method for serial sampling and real-time monitoring of the disease.15 Notably, lymphatic fluid liquid biopsy has demonstrated promise in predicting recurrence in HPV-positive HNSCC with higher sensitivity compared to blood-based assays.208

## **Emerging Gene Therapies and Oncolytic Virus Therapies**

The fields of gene therapy and oncolytic virus therapy are rapidly advancing, offering novel approaches to the treatment of head and neck cancer.

### **Gene Replacement and Gene Silencing Strategies**

Gene therapy involves the introduction of genetic material into cells to treat or prevent disease. It is an evolving field with increasing applications in head and neck cancer.8 Corrective gene therapy aims to block the activity of oncogenes or replace tumor suppressor genes that are defective in cancer cells, such as the p53 gene.228 Gendicine, a gene therapy product based on the recombinant p53 gene, has been approved in China for the treatment of head and neck cancer and has shown synergistic effects when combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.19 Gene silencing strategies, such as using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target oncogenes like EGFR, are also being explored in combination with other therapies like photodynamic therapy to inhibit cancer growth.234 Clinical trials are currently investigating the efficacy of various gene therapies for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.227

### **Oncolytic Viruses**

Oncolytic viruses are a class of viruses that have the ability to selectively infect and destroy tumor cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. They also have the potential to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response.1 T-VEC (talimogene laherparepvec) is a modified herpes simplex virus that is FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma and is currently being tested in clinical trials for head and neck cancer, often in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab.221 Oncorine (H101), an oncolytic adenovirus, has been approved in China for the treatment of head and neck cancer in combination with chemotherapy and has shown promising response rates in clinical trials.19 Another oncolytic virus, MVR-T3011, which is engineered to express a PD-1 antibody and IL-12, is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.160

## **Expert Opinions and Future Directions**

Leading researchers and clinicians in the field of head and neck cancer are optimistic about the future of treatment, emphasizing a continued shift towards precision medicine and less toxic therapeutic strategies.4 The importance of multidisciplinary care teams and addressing the psychosocial needs of patients with this disease is also being increasingly recognized.262 For HPV-positive head and neck cancers, there is a strong focus on developing treatment de-escalation strategies to reduce long-term side effects while maintaining high cure rates.90 However, there remains a significant need for the development of more effective treatments for HPV-negative head and neck cancers and for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease, where current options are often limited.28

Emerging trends in the treatment of head and neck cancer include the continued development and refinement of novel immunotherapies and their combinations with other modalities.4 There is also significant interest in advancing targeted therapies that go beyond EGFR, addressing other key pathways involved in head and neck cancer development and progression.4 The use of advanced radiation techniques like proton therapy is expected to increase, and the potential of FLASH radiation therapy to reduce toxicity is a highly anticipated breakthrough.60 The refinement of minimally invasive surgical techniques and the increasing adoption of robotic surgery are also expected to continue, offering patients less invasive treatment options with improved functional outcomes.3 The integration of personalized medicine approaches, utilizing biomarkers and liquid biopsies to guide treatment decisions, is also a significant trend that is expected to continue to advance.1 Finally, the development of novel gene therapies and oncolytic viruses offers exciting possibilities for future treatment paradigms.1 While significant progress has been made, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity and resistance to therapies persist.2 However, the ongoing research and technological advancements offer numerous opportunities to overcome these hurdles and further improve patient outcomes.

## **Conclusion**

Emerging treatment strategies for head and neck cancer represent a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. Advancements in immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, minimally invasive surgery, and novel combination approaches are offering new hope for patients with this challenging disease. The increasing integration of personalized medicine, guided by sophisticated biomarkers and liquid biopsy techniques, promises to further refine treatment strategies and improve outcomes. While challenges remain, the future landscape of head and neck cancer treatment is poised for significant progress, with the potential to enhance both survival rates and the quality of life for patients.
