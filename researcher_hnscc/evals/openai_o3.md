**Evaluation rubric**

| # | Criterion | Why it matters | 5 = Outstanding | 3 = Adequate | 1 = Poor |
|---|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| **1** | **Accuracy** ★★★ | Factual correctness & absence of misleading statements | No substantive errors; numbers & approvals correct to Apr 2025 | Minor slips or un‑sourced claims | Material mistakes or outdated / wrong approvals |
| **2** | **Clarity** ★★ | Ease of reading, logical flow, jargon control | Concise headings, limited run‑on text, crisp prose | Readable but wordy | Disorganized or hard to follow |
| **3** | **Comprehensiveness** ★★ | Breadth & depth across modalities (immuno, targeted, RT, surgery, combos, biomarkers, etc.) | Balanced, touches all key domains with clinical context | Covers most domains, some thin spots | Major areas missing |
| 4 | Currency | Includes 2023‑25 data (e.g. toripalimab, efti + pembro, FLASH) | ≥3 very recent items and notes discontinuations | Few 2024‑25 data | Stops at ≤2022 |
| 5 | Structure / Formatting | Use of hierarchy, bullets, tables | Clear hierarchy & helpful tables | Basic sectioning | Wall of text |
| 6 | Citation quality | Frequencies, reliability, linkage | Properly cites primary/official sources | Sporadic or only generic refs | Almost no sourcing |
| 7 | Critical appraisal | Calls out limitations, resistance, trial phase | Discusses caveats & trial maturity | Occasional caveats | Pure listing, no critique |

*(★ weights: Accuracy ×3, Clarity & Comprehensiveness ×2 each; others ×1.)*

### Scoring the examples  

| Example | Accuracy (×3) | Clarity (×2) | Comprehensive (×2) | Currency | Structure | Citations | Critique | **Weighted total /50** |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| **A** | 4 → 12 | 3 → 6 | 4 → 8 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **41** |
| **E** | 3 (Jemperli mis‑stated as HNSCC‑approved; some numeric estimates shaky) → 9 | 3 → 6 | 5 → 10 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | **43** |
| **C** | 3 (same Jemperli error; some overstated approvals) → 9 | 2 → 4 | 5 → 10 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **38** |
| **B** | 4 → 12 | 4 → 8 | 3 → 6 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | **36** |
| **D** | 4 → 12 | 4 → 8 | 2 → 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **36** |

### Forced ranking

| Rank | Example | Strengths | Key gaps / concerns |
|------|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **1** | **E** | Most wide‑ranging (immuno, targeted, RT, surgery, delivery, biomarkers) with self‑critique matrix & quantitative tables; excellent organization | Mislabels **dostarlimab** as FDA‑approved for HNSCC (only dMMR endometrial); a few speculative numbers; dense for lay readers |
| **2** | **A** | Highly accurate, deeply referenced, strong on recent immuno & targeted data; explicit subtype tables | Light on radiation & surgical advances; very long paragraphs hurt readability |
| **3** | **C** | Broad like E, many modality details & tables | Same Jemperli error; prose bulkier, citation style harder to trace; fewer caveats |
| **4 (tie)** | **B** | Clear prose, covers radiation & surgery succinctly; good balance | Less depth on biomarkers, gene/virus therapy; sparse citations; some trial names missing; minor speculative combo (BL‑B01D1) over‑emphasised |
| **4 (tie)** | **D** | Concise executive‑style summary, recent references, decent critique | Least comprehensive (gene, delivery, biomarkers barely touched); light citations; some links go to press releases not primary data |

---

### Notable inaccuracies or omissions

| Example | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| **C & E** | State **dostarlimab (Jemperli)** is **approved** for HNSCC – not correct (only FDA‑approved for dMMR endometrial & solid tumors under tissue‑agnostic indication). |
| **C** | Claims KSQ‑004EX trial already open (FDA IND only cleared April 2025); overstated clinical availability. |
| **B** | Highlights BL‑B01D1 combo as if late‑phase; actually first‑in‑human (NCT06437522) with no efficacy data yet. |
| **A** | Near‑absolute (“100% disease control”) tipifarnib figure comes from small interim analysis; needs caution. |
| **D** | Calls CTLA‑4 blockers “show promise” without quoting negative CheckMate 651 primary endpoint failure. |

Significant **missing areas**:

- **Radiation innovations** (FLASH, adaptive proton) under‑covered in **A**.  
- **Gene / oncolytic virus therapy** absent in **B** & **D**.  
- **Liquid‑biopsy biomarkers** largely missing in **A**, **B**, **D**.

## Summary

Using a rubric that weights **accuracy**, **clarity**, and **comprehensiveness** most heavily, Example E edges out Example A for the top spot because of its unmatched scope, tight structure, and explicit self‑critique—despite a notable approval mis‑statement that future edits should correct. Example A ranks a close second with excellent factual depth but narrower modality coverage and readability challenges. Examples C, B, and D trail for a mix of accuracy slips, citation sparsity, or limited breadth.
